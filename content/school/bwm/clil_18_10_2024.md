# Case Study "NiCO MONACO e. U."

<!-- 
In her shop, Ms Monaco also offers coffee and pastries, which she serves on small bar tables. For this purpose, she ordered 10 tablecloths from a company called “Tableware und Mehr”. The agreed date of delivery was between 13 and 16 August. As of today, 1 September, the tablecloths have not yet been delivered. Ms Monaco calls “Tableware und Mehr” and learns that because of a supply bottleneck the tablecloths will not be delivered until mid-September.

a) Explain whether this case represents a transaction for delivery at a fixed date or a transaction for delivery at an approximate date.

b) Specify the date on which a delay in delivery by “Tableware und Mehr” has occurred.

c) Ms Monaco’s shop is very busy and attracts many customers, so she needs the tablecloths as soon as possible. A delivery in mid-September would be too late. Describe what Ms Monaco should do in order to buy tablecloths before mid-September from a different dealer.

On 7 June, Ms Monaco received a delivery of a new engraving machine to manufacture her jewellery. After a few days, the machine suddenly stops working while she is in the midst of making a bracelet. It turns out that the cable is defective.

a) Classify this defect according to the different types of defects.

b) Explain which legal claim Ms Monaco has on the basis of warranty. Briefly give reasons for your answer.

c) Describe an appropriate way in which the defect can be remedied as quickly as possible.

d) Due to the fact that the machine is defective, Ms Monaco is only able to produce and sell half of the required bracelets. Does this also give rise to a claim for damages under the Product Liability Act?

e) The dealer offers a guarantee of three years for the new engraving machine. Name two differences between a guarantee and a warranty. -->
