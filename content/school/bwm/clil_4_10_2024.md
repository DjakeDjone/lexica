## 5 payment amount

12. June 20xx: 9.786,00 € including VAT

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Net amount} &= \frac{9.786,00}{1 + 0,20} = 8.155,00 € \\
\text{Cash discount} &= 0,03 \cdot 8.155,00 = 244,65 € \\
\text{Net amount after cash discount} &= 8.155,00 - 244,65 = 7.910,35 €
\end{align*}
$$

## 6

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Cash discount} &= \frac{\text{Cash discount}}{\text{Net amount after cash discount}} \cdot 100 \% \\
&= \frac{244,65}{7.910,35} \cdot 100 \% = 3,09 \%
\end{align*}
$$

The annual interest rate that corresponds to the cash discount is 3,09%. This means that if the customer pays the invoice within 7 days, they save 3,09% of the net amount.
